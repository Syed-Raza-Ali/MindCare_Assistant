            "* **Irritability and anger:**  Increased frustration, easily provoked anger, or general irritability.\n",
            "* **Anxiety and restlessness:** Feeling anxious, on edge, or unable to relax.\n",
            "* **Feeling worthless or guilty:**  Excessive self-criticism, feelings of inadequacy, or guilt over past actions, even minor ones.\n",
